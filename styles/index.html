                        <li> I had watched it once during quarantine, but this time I was fully sobbing because of both the story and the
                            conversation  about family my roommates and I had after the movie.  When I tell you my voice was cracking, I was hyperventilating..... 
                        it was bad to say the least.</li>

                        <li>I watched it during a time I was very homesick so watching this show about Chinese families made me cry on like .... every episode. 
                            There was one throwback scene where one of the three children is sent to work at a field and when the father goes to pick him up, he shows up
                            covered in dirt ---- my friend laughed at me.

                            I also watched this when quarantine measures in Argentina finally allowed me to go to my friend's, 
                            where we watched this movie and both of us ended up sobbing. 
                            I think half of the reason why we cried so hard is because we had spent too much time in lockdown so we 
                            were both feeling emotions for the first time, but when I showed it to my friends in freshman year, we all cried -- just not as much.

                            Fun fact: my friend and I went to watch this movie at Regal, in a room with reclining chairs. I completely forgot that my school bag was 
                            under my feet, so when I put my chair back to normal position, my computer got completely crushed ..... The movie was really sad though,
                            I will say. I actually shook from crying and was very --- in a good way --- surprised with Jim Parsons' performance.

                            I started this show on the plane coming back to New York last July; I thought it would be a slow slice of life type show, and while
                            it was kind of that, I did not expect to be actually crying as much as I did on that plane seat. The show was so cute and sad I cried in
                            most episodes.

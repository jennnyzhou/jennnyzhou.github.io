        <h2>Lima, Perú</h2>

            CAN YOU TELL ME A BIT ABOUTYOUR FAMILY'S IMMIGRATION HISTORY AND HOW THEY CAME TO LATIN AMERICA?
            <br><br>
            My family is from Okinawa, an island from Japan (got colonized by Japan). My great grandparents from my father’s side moved to Peru. My great grandparents on my mother’s side moved to Brazil. Both my mom and my grandma were born in Brazil, and everyone on my dad’s side was born in Peru. I'm a third generation Peruvian from my dad’s side. I still have family in Brazil but most of my relatives are in Peru as of now. During my great grandparents’ time, there was a lot of people publicizing South America as this place with a lot of opportunities working in agriculture and stuff like that. And because Okinawa at that time didn’t have a lot of opportunities, a lot of people immigrated to South America, especially Peru, Brazil, and Mexico. 
<br><br>

HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY IN TERMS OF ETHNIC BACKGROUND?
<br><br>
I mean I definitely see myself as an Asian person, but also would like to think of myself as Latino, right? Because I was born and raised in Peru, and I feel like that’s the culture I was most surrounded by. 
<br><br>

WHAT ASPECTS OF ASIAN AND/OR LATIN AMERICAN CULTURE OR HERITAGE DO YOU FEEL MOST CONNECTED TO, AND HOW DO YOU EXPRESS THEM IN YOUR DAILY LIFE?
<br><br>
I feel like Spanish is very prominent in my daily life. I use it to talk to all my friends from Peru and my family since my parents are second generation in Peru. They speak Japanese but it’s not great, so I was never taught how to speak it at home. So I feel like language, more specifically Spanish, is something that I use every single day. Another thing is that Peru is a very conservative country, and I feel like religion plays a big part of it. Even though I don’t consider myself extremely Catholic, some of the things that I was taught at Catholic school still remain with me, in terms of ways of thinking, as well as ethics and morals of Catholicism. Not necessarily in a positive or negative way, they just stay within me. The way I behave, I feel like, is very rooted in a Peruvian way of life. 
<br><br>

ARE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY ASIAN OR LATINX CULTURAL OR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS IN YOUR AREA?
<br><br>
I’d love to say yes, but no. I’m not a huge club or organization person – I’m just not used to that stuff. I’d love to learn more about clubs, though. The thing is that I have this internalized thing where I’m scared of not fitting in in a Latinx club, an Asian international, or an Asian American club because a lot of people get confused when I say I’m from South America. Sometimes I also just don’t feel Asian or Latino enough to participate in them. Maybe that’s just my mind and my anxiety, but I feel like that’s one reason why I haven’t partaken in those activities. I recently went to an Asian club meeting because my friend is part of that. It’s just very interesting because you can see the community and how people connect through similar experiences they’ve shared and it’s very cool, but maybe one day I could create my own club, you know, like an Asian Latinx club. Who knows?

<br><br>
HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE THE USE OF LANGUAGE IN YOUR DAILY LIFE?
<br><br>
Going back to language, I still use Peruvian slang when I speak, and I don’t necessarily behave like an American person. I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s just a different culture and it affects the way I express myself. Spanish definitely plays a big part in the way I carry myself in expressing myself daily. 
<br><br>

ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC CULTURAL TRADITIONS OR CELEBRATIONS FROM YOUR FAMILY'S HERITAGE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO OBSERVE?
<br><br>
Like I mentioned before, Peru is very Catholic, so because of that, I grew up going to mass and stuff like that. But my family still partakes in traditions from Okinawa, so we have a butsudan and put an incense in it to connect us with our ancestors. I still highly respect that and share those beliefs. Everytime I go back to Peru, I take part in Catholic holidays, but also still celebrate and honor Okinawan Japanese Buddhist traditions.
<br><br>

DID YOU EVER GO TO A LANGUAGE CLASS ON WEEKENDS? ANY MEMORABLE EXPERIENCES THAT CAME OUT OF THAT?
<br><br>
I did for a year, but my teacher had really bad breath, so my sister complained. And then drama kind of unfolded, so we had to drop out. 
<br><br>

WHAT IS YOUR CULTURAL HERITAGE, AND HOW HAS IT INFLUENCED YOUR UPBRINGING AND IDENTITY?
<br><br>
Growing up Asian in South America, in my earliest memory, I never thought I was different from the other kids in South America. I didn’t see myself as an Asian person also because my parents decided to not send me to a Japanese school, so I wasn’t really surrounded by many Asian people. I saw myself solely as Peruvian, and not Asian, which is interesting because I vividly remember how when I was young, I’d use words that were in Japanese because that’s how my grandma would talk to me. I would use these words at school and people wouldn’t understand me, but I thought that that was Spanish. That kind of made me start to realize that maybe I’m kind of different. I started conceptualizing race and heritage; for a long time I was very distant with my Asian side, especially because there’s so much racism in Peru, even though there’s such a big community of Asian people. It’s very normalized racism, so I don’t think I ever embraced my Asian side until I was probably around fifteen. It became easier when I became a teenager because a lot of Asian things suddenly became trendy, so it was less weird for me to eat stuff or talk about Asian entertainment.Finally, when I moved to New York, it was the first time in which I had an Asian friend group, but also friends from all over Latin America. I started embracing aspects of my life that I never really embraced. It was finally when I came to the US, that it also came into play the fact that a lot of people don’t conceptualize that immigration doesn’t only happen from Asia to America. It can also happen in other countries. It’s just crazy for them to see me speaking Spanish. I know that sometimes they don’t mean harm, but often come up with very racist comments, like “no sabía que los chinos hablan español”. We went to a Bad Bunny concert, and it was just so crazy how so many people would comment about us being there just because we’re Asians. They would not see us as Latinos at all, even though we were fully speaking to each other in fluent Spanish. It’s just interesting to me that this kind of stuff only happens in the US; when I’m in South America, maybe I’ll get a small comment but they wouldn’t straight up assume I came from China, and still refer to me knowing I am Asian Peruvian. Here, many Latinx people just assume we’re not actually from Latin America because we don’t look the part. It’s really hard to find a community when the communities that you’re basically part of push you away so much. Anyways, growing up being both Latino and Asian, I can finally say that I’m embracing both sides — but at the same time, sometimes it’s really hard because people just don’t see you as either, or only focus on one side. I’m still finding my place in the world.

        <h1>DAVID KIM</h1>  
        <h2>São Paulo, Brasil</h2>

        <p>
            CAN YOU TELL ME A BIT ABOUTYOUR FAMILY'S IMMIGRATION HISTORY AND HOW THEY CAME TO LATIN AMERICA?
            <br><br>
            I'm a second generation Korean in Brazil. Basically, how it came to happen is, my parents met here in Brazil. When it comes to my dad’s side, they had a clothing shop back in Korea with my grandparents. Unfortunately, there was a fire (from what they told me), and they lost all their belongings — all their money got collected and they basically lost everything. Then my grandparents were like, “why not start our lives again,” you know? Because it was in the midst of the Korean War, and there was a lot of tension going on with the North, they kind of just decided to hop in a boat and go to Brazil. They also considered the US, but eventually chose Brazil because they thought back then that Brazil was less racist. 
From my mom’s side, my grandfather was from North Korea, and my grandmother was from South Korea. My grandfather used to work for the Korean army as a translator for Japanese newspapers during Imperial Japan’s rule in Korea. He immigrated all the way from the North to the South, and met my grandmother there. I think they weren’t doing as financially well as they wanted to, so they essentially did the same thing as my grandparents from my dad’s side and they hopped on a boat to come all the way down to Brazil. My parents eventually met at a Korean church in Brazil; fun fact: there are more Korean churches in Brazil than Korean restaurants. It’s kind of funny. There’s a very big prevalent Christian community. There were around fifty thousand Koreans in Brazil back in the early 2000s, but I think it diminished to around thirty thousand, because so many Koreans went back to Korea, went to the United States, or started a new life elsewhere. 

<br><br>

HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY IN TERMS OF ETHNIC BACKGROUND?
<br><br>
Going back to my parents, they had me after the whole meeting at a Korean church, and now I am a Korean Brazilian studying in the US, which is a weird thing to think about. I am from Sao Paulo, Brazil. I am currently studying here at UC Berkeley,  double majoring in Econ and Data Science.
<br><br>

WHAT ASPECTS OF ASIAN AND/OR LATIN AMERICAN CULTURE OR HERITAGE DO YOU FEEL MOST CONNECTED TO, AND HOW DO YOU EXPRESS THEM IN YOUR DAILY LIFE?
<br><br>
Something that keeps me grounded to my Brazilian roots is definitely the music. I grew up listening to a lot of Bossa Nova. I mean, I brought my guitar here. I have jazz practice later, so I'm gonna play some of my tunes. And a lot of the repertoire for jazz is Bossa Nova, and just a way for me to keep ground to my culture. I also feel very homesick from food. I think it’s true for any culture, honestly, but it’s something very dear to my heart. For my Korean aspect, I feel like I’m very disconnected; I look very, very Korean, though, which is something that makes people ask like “oh, are you Korean from this part, that part?” which is also something that I need to think about. Of course, I’ve been trying to learn Korean through different sites and friends. I definitely want to get closer to my Korean side, e.g. visit Korea a lot more. 
<br><br>

ARE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY ASIAN OR LATINX CULTURAL OR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS IN YOUR AREA?
<br><br>
I am a part of the Brasa community, which is the Brazilian student association here in Berkeley. I’m not that active, but I go to the semester barbecues. I’m also part of this Asian American association here at Berkeley, which is just a bunch of Asian Americans — I’m not even American, though, I’m just Asian. 

<br><br>
HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE THE USE OF LANGUAGE IN YOUR DAILY LIFE?
<br><br>
Portuguese is my first language. I mean, technically Korean, since I went to a Korean kindergarten first, but learned very basic Korean there. Then, my parents transferred me to this Brazilian elementary school. After that, when I was around ten, they were randomly like “oh, do you want to study in the US?” I was kind of like “why not?” but also I was ten, so it just sounded cool to me. They then transferred me to this British international school in Brazil. That’s where I did middle school and started learning English. Then in high school, they transferred me to this American international school in Brazil. 
Going back to your question, because of this whole conundrum, these melting pots of languages kind of got to me. Basically, I grew up listening to Korean my whole life, and my parents can speak Korean and Portugueses. My Korean is very limited — I don’t know any slang — it’s very conversational formal Korean that I know. I can speak to elderly people, but if I speak to younger Koreans, it’s not gonna work that well. Sometimes, my parents speak Portuguese and I speak Portuguese back, or they speak Korean to me, but growing up, I never really tried to speak Korean back to them, which is something I should have done, looking back. It’s a weird dynamic — from an outsider perspective, it sounds kind of weird, but it feels very normal to me. Also, my Spanish is probably better than my Korean. 
<br><br>

ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC CULTURAL TRADITIONS OR CELEBRATIONS FROM YOUR FAMILY'S HERITAGE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO OBSERVE?
<br><br>
I don’t think there’s any big Korean celebration that I celebrate. I think it depends on where I am, you know? Say I’m back in Brazil, I actually celebrate the holidays there, but when I’m in the US, I celebrate whatever holidays from here. I’m aware when it’s, say, Carnival in Brazil, but I’m not gonna be wearing festival or colorful clothing here in California. It’s more of being aware these things are happening, but since I’m here, I think I should celebrate what is offered here. But it’s also important to be aware of the things that are happening, as I think having this global and cultural perspective of other places is very important. 
<br><br>

DID YOU EVER GO TO A LANGUAGE CLASS ON WEEKENDS? ANY MEMORABLE EXPERIENCES THAT CAME OUT OF THAT?
<br><br>
In terms of memorable experiences? I think it's more traumatic, honestly.  Especially my Korean classes. I remember my disinterest in the Korean language when I was younger kind of stemmed from my teachers — they were very harsh. And when I was in Korean preschool, I would hide from the teachers and play on my Nintendo DS. That was definitely a core memory. Then, as I grew older, in late middle school, I had this Korean private tutor, so I started learning more Korean, also learning about culture. I kind of was like, “oh, that makes sense,” you know — I think it just comes with maturity. 
When I was traveling, there was this one time I was in London with my sister and my mom, and we were in a palace. We were seeing this parade of like, the Queen’s Guard or something. I was quite young, but I remember we were just sitting there and there was this really rude Brazilian couple behind us. They were talking to each other saying things like “look at all these Japs here,” and my sister immediately turned around and confronted them in Portuguese, which made them shut their mouths really quickly. 
<br><br>

WHAT IS YOUR CULTURAL HERITAGE, AND HOW HAS IT INFLUENCED YOUR UPBRINGING AND IDENTITY?
<br><br>
It’s kind of hard to gauge that question because it’s like I can’t compare because I have never lived a different life compared to someone else, but I can tell it’s not ‘normal’ for a lot of people. It’s not normal for us, at least, studying in the US, having that opportunity, there’s not that many Asian South Americans coming here. And because of that, just being aware of your background and where you came from is a very important aspect. But in terms of engaging and how that impacts your life, I don’t think there’s a way you can measure that, because you’re yourself. You cannot control where you’re born, or who you are, so just being aware of where you came from is very important.

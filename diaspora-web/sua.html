        <h2>Ciudad de Guatemala, Guatemala</h2>

        <p>
            CAN YOU TELL ME A BIT ABOUTYOUR FAMILY'S IMMIGRATION HISTORY AND HOW THEY CAME TO LATIN AMERICA?
            <br><br>
            My dad went to Guatemala first, because some of my uncles were already there, and he wanted to start a business, hence the move. He worked with my uncles, and then my mom, brother and I immigrated later.
<br><br>
HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY IN TERMS OF ETHNIC BACKGROUND?
<br><br>
I mostly say I’m from Guatemala, and if they ask more questions I say I was born in Korea but moved to Guatemala when I was young, or just say I was raised in Guatemala my whole life. I was four months old when I moved there. So basically I was born there, but not really. 
<br><br>
WHAT ASPECTS OF ASIAN AND/OR LATIN AMERICAN CULTURE OR HERITAGE DO YOU FEEL MOST CONNECTED TO, AND HOW DO YOU EXPRESS THEM IN YOUR DAILY LIFE?
<br><br>
I would say I’m more closely attached to Korean culture, just because both my parents are Korean, and they’re also immigrants so they still kept their cultural celebrations, so I’m more familiar or close to Korean culture. In terms of language, I speak Korean with a lot of my friends and also always with my parents, so I’m more comfortable with that, so in general, culturally wise, I’m more connected to my Korean side.
<br><br>
ARE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY ASIAN OR LATINX CULTURAL OR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS IN YOUR AREA?
<br><br>
I’m involved in a Korean club in my school right now, but not any Latino clubs. During freshman year, I was more involved in the Korean American Student Association here at USC, but now I’m more involved in a career oriented Korean club. It’s more like half professional, half social for Koreans (or anyone) to find jobs or learn new skills to get jobs.
<br><br>
HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE THE USE OF LANGUAGE IN YOUR DAILY LIFE?
<br><br>
I use English for like, I guess I'm living in the US right now, so I have to use English. Spanish I only use with my friends back at home, or my friends that I know speak Spanish as well. But sometimes, since I’m in LA, there’s a lot of places where I can use Spanish. I actually don’t really use it that much, but when I use it, I’m kind of proud that I speak Spanish because no one really expects me to speak Spanish. At the same time, there’s Koreatown here, so whenever we go to restaurants I try to speak Korean with the staff. Also a lot of my friends are Korean so sometimes I use Korean with them, as well as when I call my parents. 
<br><br>
ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC CULTURAL TRADITIONS OR CELEBRATIONS FROM YOUR FAMILY'S HERITAGE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO OBSERVE?
<br><br>
I definitely see more Korean celebrations, just because most of my friends are also Korean, so they all know about those celebrations. We celebrate Lunar New Year, or there’s something called Chuseok in Korea, which is essentially a Korean Thanksgiving. I guess those are the two biggest celebrations I see here.
<br><br>
DID YOU EVER GO TO A LANGUAGE CLASS ON WEEKENDS? ANY MEMORABLE EXPERIENCES THAT CAME OUT OF THAT?
<br><br>
I went to Korean school on Saturdays. I used to go not to learn, but rather to just fuck around with my friends because we were all put in there and obviously none of us wanted to be there. It didn’t really matter if we did super well or not, we were just having fun. There would also be lunch time, and they sold instant ramen, or just snacks, like chips and stuff. So I guess the most memorable time is us running to the cafeteria and then eating together. 
<br><br>
WHAT IS YOUR CULTURAL HERITAGE, AND HOW HAS IT INFLUENCED YOUR UPBRINGING AND IDENTITY?
<br><br>
I’ve definitely had an identity crisis at some point. I guess moving here because I didn’t know if I identified as a Korean or a Latina, but then I just realized that what I got from both my cultural backgrounds is that I don’t identify as either or, but rather more like a combination of both.

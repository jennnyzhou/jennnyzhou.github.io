            CAN YOU TELL ME A BIT ABOUTYOUR FAMILY'S IMMIGRATION HISTORY AND HOW THEY CAME TO LATIN AMERICA?
            <br><br>
            For some background,  Korea had a very big economic disaster back in the 90s, and my parents were both back in High School then. Both my parents had similar thoughts of “oh if we want to make money and find a job, then we have to go abroad,” so they both decided to major in Spanish in college, in their respective schools. Long story short, when they graduated, they did a few years abroad in Colombia, Mexico, and other Latin American countries. They ended up meeting in Mexico City, in a Korean company. They started dating, got married, and then moved to a city called Guadalajara, where my brother and I were born. We spent thirteen years living in Guadalajara, until my dad had to move to China for his job, so our whole family moved there for two years, and then back to Mexico for two more years. Then, my parents said that they thought we [brother and I] were “losing our roots”, so we moved to Korea for the rest of my high school and my brother’s middle school.

HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY IN TERMS OF ETHNIC BACKGROUND?
<br><br>
I just say that I'm  Korean, because I don't know if it's a me thing or if it's something that other people experience too, but  when I say I'm Mexican, I don't think it's necessary to have the reaction of, “oh, you're Mexican? Oh, but you’re Asian.” I don't like that reaction personally. So, it’s only when people say they’re from places like Mexico, Spain, Colombia, etc. that then I say I was born in Mexico and speak Spanish. That’s when I would start setting the connection. I don’t think it’s necessary to say I was born in Mexico from the start.
<br><br>
WHAT ASPECTS OF ASIAN AND/OR LATIN AMERICAN CULTURE OR HERITAGE DO YOU FEEL MOST CONNECTED TO, AND HOW DO YOU EXPRESS THEM IN YOUR DAILY LIFE?
<br><br>
You know, honestly, I feel a very big disconnect to my Mexican, I guess you could call it heritage. Due to the fact that I don't feel that much connection to it now that I'm not living there, as my family has been living in Korea for the past, like, five–six years, and I've been to Mexico, what, like, two times in the past five–six years. All of my friends and all the people I knew are growing farther apart from what I've known back in middle school. Because honestly, having lived there in middle school, it's not really a culture that's very big in me, now that I'm twenty-one. And I guess that's why I think that I'm mostly Korean; but at the same time I think I’m more ‘Korean International’ than Mexican in a way. Which has certainly been confusing if you talk about culture and identity, because I did have a lot of trouble back when I was in Mexico questioning to myself, like… am I Mexican? Why am I not like these people? Why am I Asian? Why am I Chinito like everyone says? And then, when I moved to China, I thought: everybody is Chino here. I’m like everybody. So when I moved to Mexico I was like… oh shit, I’m realizing that I have been being treated differently due to my difference in cultural and racial background, and I don’t really feel comfortable here. I feel like a foreigner. That’s when I first felt it — when I moved back to Mexico after two years in China. And of course, Mexico is really into my heart and childhood; it has my comfort food, and means so many things to me, but I don’t really think that it currently takes up a lot of my cultural identity. 
<br><br>
ARE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY ASIAN OR LATINX CULTURAL OR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS IN YOUR AREA?
<br><br>
I am currently the vice president of the Korean community, KISP. As for any Latinx communities, I am not aware of any that exist. Maybe they do,  but  yeah, I haven't met that many Latinx people in my time at Parsons, honestly. 
<br><br>
HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE THE USE OF LANGUAGE IN YOUR DAILY LIFE?
<br><br>
I have a very big thing where I'm used to communicating or thinking about a person in the language that I'm used to when talking to them. For example, with my brother, we grew up speaking Spanish with a slight mix of English, but we do not speak Korean to each other. So it's Spanglish back and forth. On the other hand, with my girlfriend, we only speak Korean. We both know English, but we only use Korean with each other, because we’re used to doing that. And then in school, if I have any Korean friends, but I introduce myself speaking English, then I don't speak Korean to them. So I have this weird thing where the language I use is depending on the person I am communicating with, and the thoughts that I’m having are also dependent on a different time — sometimes they randomly switch. But I guess the ratio of Spanish being that language has decreased a lot because I haven’t been using it daily in, like I said, five–six years.
<br><br>
ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC CULTURAL TRADITIONS OR CELEBRATIONS FROM YOUR FAMILY'S HERITAGE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO OBSERVE?
<br><br>
You know something interesting? A lot of the Korean Mexican families that I've observed from my time in Mexico had this tendency to lose their Korean traditions and festivities. As in, we wouldn’t do Korean traditions such as Korean Thanksgiving or Lunar New Year. A lot of these would be lost in the process of getting into Mexican culture, where you would kind of lose both and not end up celebrating either culture’s festivities. We celebrate New Years and Christmas because those are such iconic holidays/traditions, but we don’t really celebrate Dia de los Muertos or Independencia. 
<br><br>
DID YOU EVER GO TO A LANGUAGE CLASS ON WEEKENDS? ANY MEMORABLE EXPERIENCES THAT CAME OUT OF THAT?
<br><br>
When I was in Mexico, my Korean was very bad. So I was nowhere near fluent in Korean. And like, the only Korean I knew was from speaking to my grandmother. My first language was Spanish, and then I got sent to an American school in Mexico for kindergarten, so English was my second language. My Korean was nowhere near speakable, and the community of Korean people in Mexico decided they couldn’t have their kids not speak any Korean, so they made their own Sunday school for Korean. It was basically a bunch of moms rotating and teaching kids Korean.  And I had that every weekend for like two–three years  in my middle school days. Which, now that I'm thinking about it, is very weird because it was just a bunch of moms.  But, I guess it was one of the first times that I actually learned Korean. Even now, I don’t have the ‘real Korean education’ because I’ve been in international schools throughout my life, so I’ve never officially learned Korean. It’s definitely a lot worse than what other Korean kids have, but I guess that I do know a lot of people that are born in foreign countries that don’t speak their ethnic language, so I think that thought was very good for me to carry on. 
<br><br>
WHAT IS YOUR CULTURAL HERITAGE, AND HOW HAS IT INFLUENCED YOUR UPBRINGING AND IDENTITY?
<br><br>
I briefly spoke about this in one of the previous questions, but I feel like being Mexican Korean has been very defining of what I think, how I think, and what I’ve been through; first of all, Mexico is a very close minded country. Any Asian you see is “chino”, and every other culture or race you see in Mexico that’s not Mexican is treated differently, even now, even today. I think that obviously my early days in Mexico didn’t really have any repercussions because I was young and I didn’t know — there’s not much I could have done. I realized ethnicity is actually very big — the people I’m with actually really define how I am, or how I feel, like how I first got comfortable when I was in China. Due to being surrounded by more Asian people before returning to Mexico made me realize that how the people there [Mexico] would be like, “oh, you actually speak spanish” whenever I spoke Spanish, was not really normal, and was quite an inconvenience to me. It really changed my outlook on race and how you treat people based on their skin color, on their appearance. In the end, it really helped me realize a lot of different things, especially returning back to Korea, about what I should feel towards my Mexican culture, what I should take and what I should cherish about my time in Mexico, because, I don’t know if you can tell, but my outlook on my time in Mexico isn’t really that positive, but I do think it’s very important to know that there are certain barriers in the world because racism is still very prevalent anywhere you go. It is important for me to know about that racism, knowing the things I went through, and how those defined who I became in a sense of race, ethnicity, or culture, and I think that’s also why I’m very comfortable now living amongst Asian people why I think that my ‘family roots’ are very important in how I live, my appearance, my culture. Honestly I go through a new phase of cultural identity, like, every year, almost. Whenever something changes, my outlook changes. For example, I might go to Mexico this winter and be like … this is why I love Mexico. Cultural identity is very hard to speak about and to define, but at the same time, to conclude, I think the ups and downs of that I went through through being Mexican Korean, definitely did help define who I’d become, and helped me know about the world earlier, in a sense.

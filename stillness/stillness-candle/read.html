    One. Choose a quiet and comfortable place to sit. <br>
    You can sit on the floor or on a chair, as long as your <br>
    back is straight and your feet are firmly planted on the ground.<br>
<br>
Two. Place a candle in front of you, at eye level, about an <br>
armâ€™s length away.<br>
<br>
Three. Light it and gaze without blinking your eyes. <br>
Try to keep your eyes focused on it and avoid any distractions.<br>
<br>
Four. If your eyes start to water, take a break and <br>
blink a few times. Then resume your focus.<br>
<br>
Five. If your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back.<br>
<br>
Six. Continue to gazing for as long as you feel comfortable. <br>
Start with just a few minutes and gradually increase the time <br>
as you become more comfortable with the practice. Work <br>
yourself up to fifteen-twenty minutes.<br>
<br>
Seven. When you are ready to finish, close your eyes and focus <br>
on your breath for a few minutes. Take deep breaths in and out, <br>
and try to relax your mind and body.

   <h2> October First </h2><br>  <p>
    Today I went to do a proper grocery run for the first <br>
    time  since I moved into my new apartment (a month <br>
    ago). I feel like because the moving process had been <br>
    so overwhelming, I had put off doing groceries and <br>
    actually cooking, which then meant I was eating out <br>
    and ordering delivery everyday. I feel like for the past <br>
    few years, I often found cooking was a way in which I <br>
    was able to nourish my body. Because some family was<br>
     also visiting, eating out everyday definitely made me <br>
     feel gross. But today has been the first official step to <br>
     get back on this routine, which also means a little <br>
     break for my wallet.<br><br>
<!-- <h2>October Second</h2><br><p>
    I think the last dream I remember having is of this <br>
    band I listen to that came to New York. A few days <br>
    after the concert, I dreamt that one of the members<br>
    replied to my Instagram message and actually had <br>
    a conversation with me. We met up for coffee .... the <br>
    delulu went crazy with this one.Â  -->

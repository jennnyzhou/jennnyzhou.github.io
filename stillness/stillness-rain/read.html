    How about being silent? <br>
    just a bit of time would do<br>
    how about staying silent,<br>
    newspapers, radios and you, too<br>
    (and also poets)?<br><br>

Can you hear the quiet <br>
that lurks between lovers at dusk?<br>
Can you hear that quiet<br>
in the gentle eyes of a deer looking at you<br>
can you hear the quiet<br>
the sky is always secretly hiding?<br><br>

Quietly<br>
so quietly as to not deafen the quiet<br>
can you say a good morning and a good night?

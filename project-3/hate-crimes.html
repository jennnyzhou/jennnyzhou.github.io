			COVID-19 has been linked to an increase in anti-Asian hate crimes in many parts of the world. This is due to a variety of factors, including xenophobia, misinformation, and scapegoating.

			<br><br>The pandemic has led to a rise in anti-Asian rhetoric and conspiracy theories, which have been spread on social media and in some cases by political leaders. Some people have blamed China and Chinese people for the spread of the virus, despite the fact that the virus is a global problem that has affected people of all races and nationalities.

			<br><br>This has led to an increase in hate crimes against Asians and Asian-Americans. According to a report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, hate crimes targeting Asian-Americans increased by nearly 150% in 2020 in major U.S. cities. The report also found that New York City saw the largest increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, with a 833% increase in 2020 compared to the previous year.

			<br><br>The impact of these hate crimes on Asian communities has been significant, with many people feeling fearful and targeted. Organizations and individuals have been working to raise awareness about anti-Asian hate crimes and to support those who have been affected by them.

            Concept
        </h3>
        <p>
           <li>Narrated by Yu Tsun</li> 
           <li>He is a spy working for Germany</li>
           <li>Yu Tsun is on a mission, and while he is doing this, he goes to meet Stephen Albert, who talks to him about Yu Tsun’s grandfather, Ts’ui Peng</li>
           <li>Ts’ui Peng has written a book about bifurcating time and parallel universes (The Garden of Forking Paths)</li>
           <li>“[Ts’ui Peng] did not think of time as absolute and uniform. He believed in an infinite series of times, in a growing, dizzying net of diverging, converging and parallel times.”</li>
           <li>Yu Tsun kills Albert as a way of announcing that the city of Albert is under attack.</li> <br>

            Concept
        </h3>
        <p>
        <li>Dark green for stable storytelling</li>
        <li>Different smaller interactions on each page (hover, choose your own path, etc)</li>
        <li>Bifurcating paths for the reader to choose from, inspired by the story's bifurcation of time</li><br>

    <h3>
        Typographic choices
    </h3>
    <p>
        <li>EB Garamond - serif</li>
        <li>This short story was set during WWI — using a serif allowed me to tell this story in a more “serious” / less modern way. </li>
        <li>Usage of different weights of the same typeface throughout the site</li>
        <li>Usage of shape in order to add more interest to the story</li> <br>

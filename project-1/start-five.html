            "The word is chess." <br><br>
            "Precisely," said Albert. "The Garden of Forking Paths is an enormous guessing game,
            or parable, in which the subject is time. The rules of the game forbid the use of the
            word itself. To eliminate a word completely, to refer to it by means of inept phrases
            and obvious paraphrases, is perhaps the best way of drawing attention to it. This,
            then, is the tortuous method of approach preferred by the oblique Ts'ui Pen in every
            meandering of his interminable novel. I have gone over hundreds of manuscripts, I
            have corrected errors introduced by careless copyists, I have worked out the plan
            from this chaos, I have restored, or believe I have restored, the original. I have
            translated the whole work. I can state categorically that not once has the word time
            been used in the whole book.<br><br>
            "The explanation is obvious. The Garden of Forking Paths is a picture, incomplete
            yet not false, of the universe such as Ts'ui Pen conceived it to be. Differing from
            Newton and Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and
            uniform. He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading
            network of diverging, converging and parallel times. This web of time - the strands of
            which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the
            centuries - embraces every possibility. We do not exist in most of them. In some
            you exist and not I, while in others I do, and you do not, and in yet others both of us
            exist. In this one, in which chance has favored me, you have come to my gate. In
            another, you, crossing the garden, have found me dead. In yet another, I say these
            very same words, but am an error, a phantom."<br><br>
            "In all of them," I enunciated, with a tremor in my voice. "I deeply appreciate and am
grateful to you for the restoration of Ts'ui Pen's garden."<br><br>
"Not in all," he murmured with a smile. "Time is forever dividing itself toward
innumerable futures and in one of them I am your enemy."<br><br>
Once again I sensed the pullulation of which I have already spoken. It seemed to me
that the dew-damp garden surrounding the house was infinitely saturated with
invisible people. All were Albert and myself, secretive, busy and multiform in other
dimensions of time. I lifted my eyes and the short nightmare disappeared. In the
black and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as strong as a
statue and this man was walking up the path and he was Captain Richard Madden.<br><br>
"The future exists now," I replied. "But I am your friend. Can I take another look at
the letter?"

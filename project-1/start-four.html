"Before I discovered this letter, I kept asking myself how a book could be infinite. I
could not imagine any other than a cyclic volume, circular. A volume whose last page
would be the same as the first and so have the possibility of continuing indefinitely. I
recalled, too, the night in the middle of The Thousand and One Nights when Queen
Scheherezade, through a magical mistake on the part of her copyist, started to tell
the story of The Thousand and One Nights, with the risk of again arriving at the
night upon which she will relate it, and thus on to infinity. I also imagined a Platonic
hereditary work, passed on from father to son, to which each individual would add a
new chapter or correct, with pious care, the work of his elders.<br><br>
"These conjectures gave me amusement, but none seemed to have the remotest
application to the contradictory chapters of Ts'ui Pen. At this point, I was sent from
Oxford the manuscript you have just seen.<br><br>
"Naturally, my attention was caught by the sentence, 'I leave to various future times,
but not to all, my garden of forking paths: I had no sooner read this, than I
understood. The Garden of Forking Paths was the chaotic novel itself. The phrase 'to
various future times, but not to all' suggested the image of bifurcating in time, not in
space. Rereading the whole work confirmed this theory. In all fiction, when a man is
faced with alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the others. In the almost
unfathomable Ts'ui Pen, he chooses - simultaneously - all of them. He thus creates
various futures, various times which start others that will in their turn branch out
and bifurcate in other times. This is the cause of the contradictions in the novel.<br><br>
"Fang, let us say, has a secret. A stranger knocks at his door. Fang makes up his mind
to kill him. Naturally there are various possible outcomes. Fang can kill the intruder,
the intruder can kill Fang, both can be saved, both can die and so on and so on. In
Ts'ui Pen's work, all the possible solutions occur, each one being the point of
departure for other bifurcations. Sometimes the pathways of this labyrinth converge.
For example, you come to this house; but in other possible pasts you are my enemy;
in others my friend.<br><br>
"If you will put up with my atrocious pronunciation, I would like to read you a few
pages of your ancestor's work."<br><br>
His countenance, in the bright circle of lamplight, was certainly that of an ancient, but
it shone with something unyielding, even immortal.

                With slow precision, he read two versions of the same epic chapter. In the first, an
army marches into battle over a desolate mountain pass. The bleak and somber
aspect of the rocky landscape made the soldiers feel that life itself was of little value,
and so they won the battle easily. In the second, the same army passes through a
palace where a banquet is in progress. The splendor of the feast remained a memory
throughout the glorious battle, and so victory followed.<br><br>
With proper veneration I listened to these old tales, although perhaps with less
admiration for them in themselves than for the fact that they had been thought out
by one of my own blood, and that a man of a distant empire had given them back to me, in the last stage of a desperate adventure, on a Western island. I remember the
final words, repeated at the end of each version like a secret command: "Thus the
heroes fought, with tranquil heart and bloody sword. They were resigned to killing
and to dying."<br><br>
At that moment I felt within me and around me something invisible and intangible
pullulating. It was not the pullulation of two divergent, parallel, and finally converging
armies, but an agitation more inaccessible, more intimate, prefigured by them in
some way. Stephen Albert continued:<br><br>
"I do not think that your illustrious ancestor toyed idly with variations. I do not find
it believable that he would waste thirteen years laboring over a never ending
experiment in rhetoric. In your country the novel is an inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's
period, it was a despised one. Ts'ui Pen was a fine novelist but he was also a man of
letters who, doubtless, considered himself more than a mere novelist. The testimony
of his contemporaries attests to this, and certainly the known facts of his life confirm
his leanings toward the metaphysical and the mystical. Philosophical conjectures take
up the greater part of his novel. I know that of all problems, none disquieted him
more, and none concerned him more than the profound one of time. Now then, this
is the only problem that does not figure in the pages of The Garden. He does not
even use the word which means time. How can these voluntary omissions be
explained?"<br><br>
I proposed various solutions, all of them inadequate. We discussed them. Finally
Stephen Albert said: "In a guessing game to which the answer is chess, which word is
the only one prohibited?" I thought for a moment and <a href="start-five.html">then replied</a>:
